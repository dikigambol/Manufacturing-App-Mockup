## 🎯 What is SCADA/HMI?

### SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
Industrial control system for **monitoring and controlling** manufacturing processes in real-time. Used in factories, power plants, water treatment, oil & gas, etc.

### HMI (Human-Machine Interface)
Visual interface that allows **operators to interact** with machines and production systems. Think of it as the "dashboard" for factory operations.

### Common Applications:
- 🏭 Production line monitoring
- ⚙️ Machine control & automation
- 📊 Real-time performance tracking (OEE, downtime, production)
- 🚨 Alarm & event management
- 📈 Historical data trending
- 🔧 Maintenance scheduling
- 📱 Mobile monitoring
